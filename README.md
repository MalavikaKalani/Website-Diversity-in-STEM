# Website-Diversity-in-STEM
A data visualization project to provide an understanding of the current state of diversity in STEM education with an emphasis on systemic patterns, barriers, and anomalies in the demographics of undergraduate STEM students. Through our website, we hope to encourage meaningful and thought-provoking conversations about diversity and equity in STEM, as it is an integral issue that impacts our society as a whole. 
# Questions we have explored
- How has the trajectory of different races in STEM education changed over the last 10 years? Has any particular marginalized group experienced a significant increase or decrease in their representation? 
- What does the distribution of STEM degrees awarded from 2009-2016 look like between males and females? Has the ratio between them changed over time to indicate more representation of females in STEM? 
- Do disabled students feel less inclined towards pursuing STEM majors as compared to non-disabled students? 
How does the intersectionality of race and sex create more marginalization in STEM education?
# Methods 
We cleaned our datasets using HTML and JavaScript and developed interactive data visualizations using the D3 library in JavaScript to communicate our data. Our comprehensive website created using WordPress and HTML encapsulates our motivation, findings, and future work.
